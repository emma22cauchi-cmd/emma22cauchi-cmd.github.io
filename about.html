              <h2>About MCAST</h2>
              <p>
                The six MCAST Institutes and the Gozo Campus provide all the technical and professional
                expertise required to deliver the programmes they offer. They maintain their position at
                the forefront of all fields of study pertinent to their disciplines. To strengthen the focus
                on the different needs of students in the various disciplines, MCAST has organised its
                programmes in two diverse study areas: Technology and Applied Sciences; and Arts and
                Social Sciences, each falling within the remit of a Deputy Principal. Simultaneously, we
                have an Applied Research & Innovation Centre within the College to support applied
                research carried out at MCAST and to ensure that it is relevant to industry and the
                country’s needs and that it is also published. This corporate structure enables the
                College to create focused strategies that address your specific needs while maintaining
                a proactive dialogue with all interested stakeholders to provide the best programmes
                for the country’s socio-economic needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                MCAST prepares students with practical skills and knowledge for
                employment and further education.
